# High-level recommendations

1. Use constants for magic numbers in audio.py: Replace magic numbers in `split_silences` function with named constants. This makes the code more readable and easier to update.
2. Improve error handling in api.py: Implement more robust error handling in `transcribe_and_return_job_id` function. This makes the application more resilient and easier to debug.
3. Add more comments in gcloud.py: Include comments to explain the purpose of `upload_to_gcloud` function and complex code blocks. This makes the code easier to understand.
4. Use design patterns in main.py: Implement appropriate design patterns in `transcribe_segment` and `transcribe_audio` functions. This can improve code organization and efficiency. For example, use the Factory pattern for creating objects, the Singleton pattern for resources that should only have a single instance, and the Observer pattern for event handling.
5. Improve data structures in audio.py: Use appropriate data structures to optimize performance in `coalesce_short_transcript_segments` function. For example, use dictionaries for lookups, sets for membership checks, and lists for ordered collections.
6. Optimize imports in all modules: Organize and optimize imports. This can improve code readability and performance. For example, group imports by standard library, third-party, and local application imports, and sort them alphabetically within each group.
7. Code formatting: Follow a consistent code formatting standard across all modules. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.
8.  Code documentation: Document the code properly in all modules. This helps other developers understand the code better.
