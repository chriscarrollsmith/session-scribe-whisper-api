# Refactoring Suggestions

1. Refactor the program architecture to follow the principles of clean architecture. This involves separating concerns into different layers, such as the domain layer (business logic), application layer (use cases), and infrastructure layer (frameworks and drivers). This will make the program architecture more interpretable and maintainable.

2. Domain Layer: This layer will contain the core business logic of the application. It will include entities like `Transcription`, `Audio`, `Video`, `PDF`, and `CloudStorage`. These entities will contain the business rules and operations related to them.

3. Application Layer: This layer will contain the use cases of the application. It will include services like `TranscriptionService`, `AudioService`, `VideoService`, `PDFService`, and `CloudStorageService`. These services will use the entities from the domain layer to perform operations.

4. Infrastructure Layer: This layer will contain the frameworks and drivers used by the application. It will include modules like `api.py`, `audio.py`, `video.py`, `pdf.py`, `gcloud.py`, and `supabase.py`. These modules will interact with external systems and services.

5. Interface Layer: This layer will contain the interfaces that the application exposes to the outside world. It will include the FastAPI application and any other interfaces that the application might have.

6. Improve data structures: Use appropriate data structures to optimize performance. For example, use dictionaries for lookups, sets for membership checks, and lists for ordered collections.

7. Use design patterns: Implement appropriate design patterns to improve code organization and efficiency. For example, use the Factory pattern for creating objects, the Singleton pattern for resources that should only have a single instance, and the Observer pattern for event handling.

8. Code formatting: Follow a consistent code formatting standard across all modules. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

9. Code documentation: Document the code properly in all modules. This helps other developers understand the code better.

10. Improve error handling: Implement more robust error handling to make the application more resilient and easier to debug. For example, use try/except blocks to catch and handle exceptions, and raise custom exceptions for specific error conditions.

11. Optimize imports: Organize and optimize imports to improve code readability and performance. For example, group imports by standard library, third-party, and local application imports, and sort them alphabetically within each group.

12. Improve naming conventions: Use more descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules. This makes the code self-explanatory and reduces the need for comments.

13. Modularize the code: Break down large functions and classes into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
